The **UVDeskAutomationBundle** enhances your [UVDesk Community][1] helpdesk by enabling the execution of custom functionalities through a robust system of events and actions. This allows support teams to automate routine tasks and streamline customer service operations using configurable Workflows and Prepared Responses, ultimately improving efficiency and response times.

The automation bundle comes loaded with the following features:

* **Workflows** - Automatically perform a defined set of actions whenever specific events—like ticket creation, status updates, or customer replies—are triggered within the helpdesk system. This streamlines repetitive tasks such as assigning agents, sending notifications, or updating ticket properties, improving efficiency and response consistency.

* **Prepared Responses** - Manually trigger a specific set of predefined actions directly from your helpdesk support panel as needed. This allows agents to apply workflows—such as sending responses, updating ticket fields, or escalating issues—on demand for greater control and flexibility.

--------------

Before installing, make sure that you have [Composer][2] installed.

To require the automation bundle into your uvdesk community helpdesk project, simply run the following from your project root:

```bash
